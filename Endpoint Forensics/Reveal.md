**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** As a cybersecurity analyst for a leading financial institution, an alert from your SIEM solution has flagged unusual activity on an internal workstation. Given the sensitive financial data at risk, immediate action is required to prevent potential breaches.

Your task is to delve into the provided memory dump from the compromised system. You need to identify basic Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and determine the extent of the intrusion. Investigate the malicious commands or files executed in the environment, and report your findings in detail to aid in remediation and enhance future defenses.

**Category:** Endpoint Forensics

**Difficulty:** Easy

**File:** `192-Reveal.dmp`

**Tools:** `Volatility 3` `VirusTotal` 

> [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.  

**Note:** In this walkthrough, I will use the SIFT Workstation from SANS to analyze the provided file. If you have not set it up yet, I highly recommend following this [forensics lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/forensics-lab/blob/main/README.md) guide for assistance with your installation.
