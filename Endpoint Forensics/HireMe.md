**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** Our intrusion detection system has alerted us to suspicious behavior on a workstation, pointing to a likely malware intrusion. A memory dump of this system has been taken for analysis. Your task is to analyze this dump, trace the malwareâ€™s actions, and report key findings. This analysis is critical in understanding the breach and preventing further compromise.

**Category:** Endpoint Forensics

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Files:** `FirstHack.ad1` `FirstHack.ad1.txt`

**Tools:** `FTK Imager`

> [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager) is a free data preview and imaging tool used to acquire electronic evidence in a forensically sound manner by creating copies of computer data without making changes to the original evidence.

**Note:** In this walkthrough, we will use the FlareVM to analyze the provided file. If you have not set it up yet, I highly recommend following this [malware analysis lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/malware-analysis-lab/blob/main/README.md) guide for assistance with your installation.
