**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** Our intrusion detection system has alerted us to suspicious behavior on a workstation, pointing to a likely malware intrusion. A memory dump of this system has been taken for analysis. Your task is to analyze this dump, trace the malwareâ€™s actions, and report key findings. This analysis is critical in understanding the breach and preventing further compromise.

**Category:** Endpoint Forensics

**Difficulty:** Easy

**File:** `file`

**Tools:** `Volatility 3`

**Note:** For this walkthrough, I have created an isolated virtual machine to analyze the provided file. If you have not set it up yet, I highly suggest following this [malware analysis lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/malware-analysis-lab/blob/main/README.md) guide for your setup. 

**Note:** For this walkthrough, I have spun up a Kali Linux virtual machine to utilize its tools. If you haven't set it up yet, I highly suggest following this [pentest lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/pentest-lab) guide for your setup.
