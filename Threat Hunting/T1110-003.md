**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.[1]

Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:

SSH (22/TCP)
Telnet (23/TCP)
FTP (21/TCP)
NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)
LDAP (389/TCP)
Kerberos (88/TCP)
RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)
HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)
MSSQL (1433/TCP)
Oracle (1521/TCP)
MySQL (3306/TCP)
VNC (5900/TCP)
In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.[2]

In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.
