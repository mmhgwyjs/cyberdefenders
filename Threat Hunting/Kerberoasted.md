**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** Our intrusion detection system has alerted us to suspicious behavior on a workstation, pointing to a likely malware intrusion. A memory dump of this system has been taken for analysis. Your task is to analyze this dump, trace the malwareâ€™s actions, and report key findings. This analysis is critical in understanding the breach and preventing further compromise.

**Category:** Threat Hunting

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Files:** `FirstHack.ad1` `FirstHack.ad1.txt` ``
