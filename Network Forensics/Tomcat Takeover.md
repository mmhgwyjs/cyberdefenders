**Platform:** CyberDefenders

**Scenario:** As a cybersecurity analyst on SecureTech's Incident Response Team, you're tackling an urgent case involving a high-profile corporation that suspects a sophisticated cyber attack on its network. The corporation, which manages critical data across various industries, has experienced a ransomware attack, leading to the encryption of files and an immediate need for expert assistance to mitigate the damages and investigate the breach.

Your role in the team is to conduct a detailed analysis of the evidence to determine the extent and nature of the attack. Your objective is to identify the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor to help your client contain the threat and restore the integrity of their network.

**Category:** Network Forensics

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Files:** ``

**Tools:** `Wireshark`

**Note:** In this walkthrough, we will use the FlareVM to analyze the provided file. If you have not set it up yet, I highly recommend following this [malware analysis lab](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/malware-analysis-lab/blob/main/README.md) guide for assistance with your installation.
